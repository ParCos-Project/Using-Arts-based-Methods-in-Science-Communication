Summary
---
**Art-form**^1^: Multiple methods approach 
Can be used to facilitate data collection about political and emotionally complex issues and is generally focused on collective, rather than individual, reflection about such issues. Can also be used to elicit narratives that capture the embodied experience and relationships to the data collected through scientific processes. This  captures both interpretation of data and emotional components.

**Steps**
1. Framing a burning issue
2. Contract for sharing 
2. Warming up (any theatre game that creates playfull atmosphere)
3. Starting in pairs: sharing an imaginative life line where burning issue is emerging. Giving a topic to it. 
4. Creating small groups (3-6 person in each) and giving a task to articulate topics in context  with the help of hot seating (drama convention where group interviews a person in role to build persona/characters in order to clairfy situated perspectives)
5. Searching data related to phenomen that is explored (identified as burning problem)
7. Reconstructioning a burning problem as an  incident which allows particpants to explore its dynamics, power tensions and  basic assumptions 
8. Identifying meanings 
9. Drawing  a map of how things are interlinking
