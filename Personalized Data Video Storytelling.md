**Steps**
1. Start with presenting a data visualization that is easy to grasp, such as an infographic. This way, it appeals to a large audience. In the case of More Weather, users were requested to input their birthday on the interactive screen. The user in turn is presented with an infographic containing the detailed weather of that exact date. It also includes the various kinds of items one might have needed on that day to carry with them. 
2. Allow the user to personalize the presented data, e.g. through adding interactivity to the infographic. For instance, based on the infographic in More Weather, further information is displayed on the screen which shows weather data from that specific date till 2020 to show various weather changes over the years. 
3. Design different narratives that each connect to underlying data points and can explain the data at hand. For example, weather data of the same date from even earlier years such as from 1920’s is displayed for interpretation. 
4. Facilitator then presents the participants with more related data to draw comparison. For example, data related to temperature of the day a participant was born was presented in the case of More Weather in order to compare how climate changes caused increase in temperature.
5. Afterwards, participants answer questions based on the methodologies set by the researchers. For instance, in the case of More Weather, these questions are based on: 
    * Contemplativeness scale- 9 questions to measure the level of reflective thinking. 
    * Emotional Engagement scale- 6 questions to gain insights in the emotional engagement with characters such as the Facilitator/ youth news presenter.	
    * Narrative engagement scale- 8 questions were asked to participants for gaining insights on how outside distractions affected their focus.

**Which stage to use it in**
* Data Visualization 
* Engaging Imagination and emotions of participants 
* When reaching out to different types of audience 
* When participants prefer to decide for themselves rather than rely on explainer

It helps participants that do not have much experience with data visualization by making it possible for them to make sense of those data in a fun and inspiring manner. 

**How to document**
Observation notes, interviews, questionnaires, videos and photos. 

**Analysis**
Quantitative and qualitative analysis
