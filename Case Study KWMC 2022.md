**ReThink-ReMake-ReCycle-Zine** 

Aim of the case study was to work towards waste reduction locally (and globally), by developing a shared understanding of ways to reduce household such as paper and plastics. We unpicked the data behind what we waste, mapping out the different types and properties of waste materials, and following a process of creative ‘Design Thinking’, prototyping and making to try and identify sustainable solutions and alternatives. 

The case study was delivered online through interactive workshops, we explored the scale and environmental impact of common household waste materials, such as paper and plastics. During the workshops, we highlighted and shared open data behind what people waste in their daily lives. This was followed by utilising digital tools and a creative process to co-design, prototype and test out sustainable alternatives.

For the case study targeted at local residents of South Bristol; 22 households signed up, 48 people participated, among them 34 were adults and 14 of them were children. Due to covid, the workshops took place virtually in November and December of 2020. The sessions included mixed presentations and video content with group discussion. Each participant received an activity pack which included; 

* Printed ‘waste audit’ sheets to measure household paper and plastic waste.
* Ingredients and tools for making bioplastic pine resin pots and gelatin – based plastic with agar agar. 
* Safety clothing for bioplastics activities. 
* A sewing kit, fabric, and towel for making washable, reusable cloths.
* A laser cut keyring made with recycled plastic sheet.

During the case study, three workshops had three different focuses. For session 1, the focus was on the question “How does waste affect our planet?”. For the 2nd session, the focus was on the topic “Plastics: Exploring recycled and bio plastics” and for the 3rd session, the focus was on the topic “Paper: Tackle waste through design thinking”. In the 3rd session, a design thinking approach (Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype and Test) was adopted in order to allow us think of ideas and prototype how to tackle waste.
Learnings from the workshops are;

* It takes twice as much water to produce a plastic water bottle as the amount of water it can hold
* Trillions of cigarette butts are thrown into the environment every year, turning into microplastic pollution.
* Plastic materials can be recycled to make Stormboard, Fishy filament, greencast and smile plastics.
* Creation of all-purpose household cleaning liquid and coconut oil deodorant to be stored in used plastic containers.
* Bioplastic pine resin pot can also be made at home with waste plastics.

The outcome of the case study is published in a [zine](https://hackmd.io/qhx9vmecTeG1wKcgXWuq5g). Interested parties can read the zine to find out what was discovered during the case study, hear participant’s stories and advice for reducing waste, and try out a range of tutorials, activities and puzzles that are inspired by the project.
