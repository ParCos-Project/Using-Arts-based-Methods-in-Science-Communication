# Case studies

Next we are shortly introducing case study context and purpose of them.

**Case study 1 (VRT)**
In this case study, we will combine citizen science on the topic of climate in a show on VRT’s TV channel oriented at children, i.e. Ketnet.

VRT is already exploring how three schools use data that is captured via air quality sensors as a conversation and/or story generator. Here, teachers and school children film their discussions on how to interpret the data, and how they can act upon.

We  are developing a tool in which (sensor) data and expert knowledge to denounce that data, and professional and user generated content come together and can be combined, edited and distributed in a television format.

We are finding solutions to following question 
* how can data be visualized in a TV show and online applications (oriented at children) to engage the viewers with this data? Furthermore, upcoming immersive storytelling technologies as augmented and virtual reality offer new data visualization opportunities that are engaging for a young audience. To tackle this question, we will set up a participatory design approach to design data visualizations for television with children. Through this approach, we will learn about their understanding of visualization and how we can translate this to storytelling.
*  how can this tool present data to television producers? Here, we draw upon existing work on narrative visualization, e.g. by deploying a line graph and annotating it with expert knowledge to highlight insights, and map this line graph on a storyline.

**Case study 2 (KWMC)**
We expand upon on our work with the Bristol Approach, a framework we developed to ensure a people and issue-led process for citizen science and engagement. Rather than pushing pre-determined ‘tech solutions’ onto people, The Bristol Approach provides a set of tools and a way of working that supports different groups to tackle the pressing issues in their community and create a greater understanding of the topic.

We  work with a diverse and inclusive community to identify issues, co-create the tools to measure, change or represent them, and then share these tools and findings openly in accessible, understandable, and contextual ways.

At the heart of this framework is the development of a ‘city commons’, where resources, tools, expertise and technologies are shared and used for the common good.These methods are key component; by supporting participants to collect their own data the process demystifies often inaccessible information. 

We are intensely interested in  following issues:
* how information is communicated, with a broad background in traditional media and a history of innovation in emergent media, 
* how immersive (e.g. VR, AR) and contextual (e.g notifications, chatbots) mediums can better communicate data and science in more personalised, accessible and intelligible ways. 
* to utilise maker space The Factory to imaginatively prototype and manufacture physical items, whether through creating eco-friendly enclosures for sensors or manufacturing objects to represent scientific data, highlight a specific challenge or opportunity relating to the data.

**Case study 3 (LUT)**
We focus on science in schools and how scientific data may be interpreted at both a local and national level and understanding what are the differences of these two contexts. In this case study, students (aged 12-14) from between 3-5 schools in Finland would be invited to collaborate on research being conducted on research projects within Finnish universities, including being given access to datasets, curated according to the ParCos project methodologies and using ParCos tools and methods to support data interpretation created as part of the project.

In this case study, the science activities that generate data that is used to create participatory science will be undertaken by research institutes and the second stage, of interpreting data and creating the stories, will be continued by school children. In this way, communications are improved between universities and schools in a local area. Students would within their own schools and local context interpret and communicate the findings, using either documentaries or VR/AR technologies as participatory science stories. Students would then engage with each others stories and try to see if a common narrative can be found, or if the local differences in context are important. 

Through this, students will learn a number of skills including
* how to conduct science inquiry
* to gain literacy skills for asking and answering questions from large data sets, either that they or others have collected
* how to communicate science through participatory techniques
* how to collaborate in interpretation of science
* to apply new technologies and techniques, such as documentary making and VR/AR.

This case study explores the importance of outreach and linking schools and research institutes as part of conducting science and the extent to which the research institutes themselves will benefit from the insights provided by the students.
