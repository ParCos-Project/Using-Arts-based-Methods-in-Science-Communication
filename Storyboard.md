Description
---

**Steps**
1. Small teams brainstorm about a design challange. 

3. The next step is that they draw one or more ideas in a scenario, in a comic book-style. The participants do not have to visualize the whole story, they can focus on a specific interaction or detail. The quality of the drawings is not important, it is more important to fully think it through.
4. Text can help to make the drawings more understandable.
6. The storyboards are hung on the wall (like in an exhibition) and presented to the other teams.
7. Participants may ask questions and discuss the interactions that have been outlined.

**Which stage to use it in**
Identification, framing (early stages)

**Why it is useful**

Storyboards are quick, low-resolution prototypes. They are helpful to communicate first ideas in the early stages of a design process. 

The visual story can help to refine the idea, and it can also reveal who will use it, where and how.

**How to document**
Collect the storyboards and write down the feedback given by the other participants. 

**Analysis**
Categorize the ideas in different groups, based on similarity. Use those insights in later design stages as different options.
