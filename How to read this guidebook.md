# How to read this guidebook

This guidebook is designed so that you can pick out individual pieces at a time, and each of them works independently, but also as part of the whole. You can  use the table of contents as your trigger to find out more about arts-based methods in the context of ParCos. Hopefully  you find what you need and will make your own connection.

You will get familiar with some fictional characters venturing in this Guidebook, they are based on experiences of several facilitators in the ParCos-project. Characters are leading you towards practical context and interaction. **Ava** is a facilitator who is working with various communities applying arts-based methods to participatory design. **Milo** is an artist who works within communities and organisations applying his artistic skills and competences - his special interest is in social justice and collective voicing. **Sophia** is a voluntary member of a community center and is interested in democratizing the ownership of data to citizens.

We hope you will be inspired thinking through following questions:
