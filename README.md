**Using Arts-based Methods in Science Communication by ParCos Project**

## Introduction
Welcome to Using Arts-Based Methods in Science Communication. This pop-up guidebook is carefully designed for you to test and taste. It is part of the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 SWAFS funded project called Participatory Communication of Science - ParCos (under grant agreement No. 872500).

This first version of guidebook has the nature of a pop-up guidebook; it is for testing ideas and getting feedback from you and other people applying arts-based methods in the context of science communication.

The communication and propagation of scientific information is easier than ever. It is no longer the case that science is conveyed through a single authoritative voice to a passive public. Tools that allow the public to collect data and offer their interpretations are being seen through large-scale and mainstream initiatives, often framed as citizen science or participatory sensing initiatives, or open knowledge sharing activities.

The Participatory Communication of Science-project aims to explore the common practices of both generating science and communicating about it in a) citizen science activities b) science in schools and c) research activities of universities.
