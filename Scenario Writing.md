Description
---

**Steps**
1.	The participants work in small groups. They brainstorm with their group about the scenario. They write their ideas on post-its.
2.	The different post-it notes are compared with each other and the group members look for clusters in the ideas (e.g. similarities), categorize and/or combine these ideas and prioritize them.
3.	Drawing (visualisation) can support the development of the textual narrative.
4.	They write the scenario.
5.	The scenarios are presented to the other teams through a theatrical performance. 
6.	After each performance, other teams can ask questions and share their observations.

**Why it is useful**
Through scenario writing people can express their ideas with a literary story in an engaging, evocative and expressive way. 

**How to document**
The written texts can function as documentation. There will also be video recordings of the performances.

**Analysis**
The different scenarios and the audiovisual materials captured during the performance can be analyzed to distil different themes.
