Summary
---
**Art-form**^1^: Performing art
Make a future story by applying post-boalian still image theatre to future studies context. Theatre director Augusto Boal created a new genre of theatre focused on development and change, namely the Theatre of the Oppressed. Post-Boalian theatre practices are various types of theatre techniques that are applied to developmental learning processes. The use of post-Boalian theatre practices focuses on the multi-voiced interpretation of existing situations; interpretation takes place between the theoretical frameworks of ‘as is’ and ‘as if’. (Pässilä, 2012)
