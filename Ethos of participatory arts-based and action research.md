# Ethos of participatory arts-based and action research 

We will meet fictional characters venturing through this Guidebook, they are based on the experiences of researchers, artist and arts-based and community-based facilitators in ParCos project. Characters   are leading you towards a practical context and interaction and helping you to find a way how to use arts-based methods .

Here again our fictional characters are saying hello to you. **Ava** is a facilitator working with various communities applying arts-based methods to participatory design. **Milo** is an artist working within communities and organisations applying his artistic skills and competencies especially in a context of social justice, collective voicing and ICT. **Sophia** is a voluntary member of a community center and interested in democratizing the ownership of data to citizens. **Ilona** is a six year old girl who is taking part in a participatory process. 

The use of and creation of these fictional characters are based on dramaturgical thinking and inspired by Lawrence & Patricia (2015) and Pässilä & Owens (2016).

Ava, Milo and Sophia are using arts-based methods on the participatory Action Research phases: plan, act, observe, reflect and we will also integrate principals of participatory design and user centred design. (Balestrini, et al, 2017 ). Ava appreciates Milo´s emphasis  of organizing reflection and questioning taken-for-granted - power position by asking: “*Who is arts-based methods in this research for? Who will benefit from participatory action research and participatory design? What are we doing for the greater good?*” (Coghlan and Brydon-Miller, 2014; Leavy, 2015; Cotter, Pässilä and Vince, 2015)

Sophia is actively involving different citizen groups  in a reflective research and design processes. She is also inspired in collaborating with Ava and Milo and saying to them:  “*My vision is that we together create valuable interaction designs that make a difference in people’s future lives. This is a focal point when  building a dialogue within and across inter- and multi-disciplinary work on children, youth and media research, and addressing the demands from policy makers*”

Ava responding to her: “*Yes, it is important in the development and testing of innovative qualitative research methods, both on a primary and meta-level. Focusing on the development of tools, worked examples and guidelines for conducting primary qualitative research with a special focus on arts-based methods and science communication with children.*”

Milo echoing both of them saying: “*It is relevant more than ever before to  focuses on the overlap between media, technology, public space and critical thinking. Our work at the grass roots level to empower children and their families  to take action about their home, street or neighborhood could be seen as new form of beautiful solidarity and appreciative activism.* “

Ava continues: “*Narratives and storytelling (Boje, 2008  ) can be a path to open and learn about benefits of  “polyphony” and “Heteroglossia” articulated in an arts-based object or process based on own experiences and interpretation (Bakhtin, 1981 ). And not to underestimate the power of imagination and imaginative thinking*.”  

They start together to recall a workshop which was orchestrated with young people and they all agreed that the concept of innovation then needs to be rethought.

Sophia: *…it becomes a question of social and interpretative dimension of innovation where children and young people are part of the knowledge production related to process renewal as well as their interpretations of existing situations and assumptions.

Milo: *The logic is to develop innovation awareness for breaking “silos of us and them”, facilitating participation, encountering each other and becoming aware of  bottlenecks between various actors; citizen groups, civic officers, local business people and artist*s.

Ava: *When creating innovations, citizens together explore and interpret their own experiences, assumptions and data; they make as well as break the sense of their actions, social processes and relations in them*. (Pässilä et al., 2013)
