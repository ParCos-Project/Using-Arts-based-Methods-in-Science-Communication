Description
---
Pretotyping (the 'pret' is for pretend) is a collection of creative methods to quickly test whether a product or service is viable before investing time and efforts in a working prototype. 

**Steps**
1. Isolate the key assumption you would solve with the prototype.
2. Write down how the prototype solves this assumption in different steps (e.g. in a storyboard, in a user journey, etc.). Divide the participants in different roles (e.g. pretend to be the prototype, pretend a user, etc.).
3. Enact the prototype and its journey in a staged setting.
4. Through this pretended play, evaluate whether the inital assumption is correct. The results may be used to develop a high fidelity prototype in a later stage. 

**Which stage to use it in**

* Identification, framing  


**Why it is useful**
*"Make sure you are building the Right it before building it right" - Alberto Savoia (Google's first Engineering director and originator of the pretotyping technique)*

Pretotyping is a cheap and fast method to gather insights in how people will interact with the product. Failing fast and cheap ulitmately helps to develop a final product with a greater chance of succeeding on the market. 

**How to document**

Document the pretotyping efforts through photos and videos. After the experience, participants may create a written or visual reflection of their experience.

**Analysis**

Discussion in group of the pretotyping experience and its reflection, which is followed by an in-group analysis.
