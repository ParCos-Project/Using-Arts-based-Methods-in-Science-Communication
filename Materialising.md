Description
---

**Steps**
1.	The participants comprehend what problem they want to solve with the design.
2.	They make a basic drawing of the installation or prototype they want to create to express their idea. This is an optional step. It is also possible to design without a preconceptual plan and think ‘with’ the materials. 
3.	They inquire the materials that are available to create a fictive prototype or installation and use the materials to give shape to their idea/solution. 
4.	The participants write their reflections and ideas down in a design diary.

**Which stage to use it in**
* Ideation
* Design

**Why it is useful**
This method is useful to build prototypes or installations, visualize ideas and experiment freely with materials. Materialising can also be used to stimulate a discussion around what has been done and to engage different participants.

**How to document**
The process and results will be captured through photos and videos. Participants write down their experiences and reflections throughout the design process in a design diary.

**Analysis**
The different materialised design outcomes and the audiovisual materials captured during the creative process can be analysed to distil different themes.
