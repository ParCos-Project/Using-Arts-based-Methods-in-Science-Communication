**Which stage to use it in**
* Is usefull for any stage where you need aesthetic distancing to organise space for thinking and talking

**Why it is useful**

We have identified this type of an Object Theatre being based on Bertolt Brecht’s idea of the alienation effect, which breaks down the illusion of cathartic theatre. The idea of aesthetic distancing puts familiar, taken-for-granted issues in a new light, making the unfamiliar familiar and vice versa; everyday affairs and relationships are explored through metaphors or roles. This allows for reflection and reflexive thinking; participants sensuously explore different type of distance related to the issues at hand.

**How to document**
Still images and audio (you can also use these as a form of evocative reporting of themes) 

**Analysis**
Discourse analysis
