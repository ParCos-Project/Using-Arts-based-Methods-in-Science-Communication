**More Weather Tomorrow, Engaging Families with Data through a Personalized Weather Forecast** 

In this case study, the authors presented the design of a video-based data storytelling application that enables families and their children to explore and interprete historical weather data through a personalized weather forecast. In today’s world, global warming and the Covid-19 pandemic has cast a shadow and they cannot be fully grasped in everyday life by citizens as making sense of these data could be challenging. Data-driven storytelling techniques offer a reliable and interactive approach to enhance data literacy skills. The inclusion of interactive data representations in video offers a more accessible way for media producers to transition to data storytelling. 

Families and children were invited to participate in interpreting historical temperature and precipitation data. The design of this personalized data video storytelling focused both on adults and children in order to encourage families to experience the data video and make sense of these data together. The personalized data video story in the form of a weather forecast application was showcased at a 2-month temporary interactive exhibition on weather, organized by a family television channel. At the same time, a comparative study with the same application was executed at home, where 19 (groups of) participants participated. In addition to this, an in-the-wild study was conducted at the exhibition for 5 days to explore how several internal story designs and external context influenced the participants narrative engagements, emotional commitment, and contemplation.

> Participants interacting with application on touchscreen

During the exhibition, the participants were asked to input their birthday on the interactive screen. The user in turn is presented with an infographic containing the detailed weather of that exact date. It also includes the various kinds of items one might have needed on that day to carry with them. In addition to that, the screen also showed further information related to weather data from that date till 2020 which portrays the change of weather over the years. Afterwards, similar weather data dated to 1920 was also displayed. At this point, the facilitator interacts with the user by showing more data related to temperature of the day a participant was born and the change of temperature of the same date over the years due to climate change. At the end, the participants were asked to answer some questions to collect further data.

> Engaging young audience in scientific weather data

The design recommendations uncovered during the case study are mentioned below: - 
* Unpredictability of the environment encourages families to engage longer with data 
* Connecting data to memories supports reflection 
* Connecting data to memories supports retelling 
* A familiar presenter establishes trust and encourages data exploration 
* Exchanging data-literacy skills supports family interaction
