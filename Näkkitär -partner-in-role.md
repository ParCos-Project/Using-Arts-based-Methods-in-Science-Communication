Summary

**Art-form**^1^: Applied drama and theater, Data Drama.  

“Drama conventions are ways of organizing time, space and action to create meaning. They allow all members of the group to participate in the drama in an organized and hopefully challenging way.  Different conventions can allow for different levels of participation which often means that at one end of the scale individuals can contribute and participate without feeling that they have to do anything embarrassing.” Owens and Barber, 2000

Description
---
Näkkitär provides the focus for the Data Drama.  Information is let out very slowly by the role who carefully listens to contributions by participants and responds to signals from them and the applied drama and theatre pedagogue by using improvisation theater skills.  Participants are aware of the person playing the Näkkitär-role and may well know them, but that person does not come out of role. The applied drama and theatre pedagogue collaborating with Näkkitär-character who uses the dynamic of the space between the participants and the role to create tension as implications are carefully explored.  

**Steps**
1. Facilitator framing dramatic challenge; Näkkitär needs help to make sense of the data, she cannot understand numbersand does not speak
2. Näkkitär-as partner-in-role is on stage, she slowly wakes up, points out the challenge to  the participants, supports and develops the drama, and individuals in it, from within the drama. 
3. Involves Näkkitär acting, requires conviction and the adoption of an attitude that can be shown in action . 

    



**Which stage to use it in**

* making meaningful links to data
 

**Why it is useful**
* to provide motivation for engagement with the data i.e. participants are ‘helping’ this character in her life, to solve a problem that she has no chance of solving on her own
* to encourage critical reflection about the human dimensions of the data
* to imagine what data is and for what purposes


**How to document**
